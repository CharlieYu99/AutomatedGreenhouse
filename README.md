# AutomatedGreenhouse
This is my Final Year Project in XJTLU
It works with another repository called AutomatedGreenhouse_django

This is the code of the automated system working on Python 3.7
Following libraries are required:
pandas, pymysql, Adafruit_DHT

A database is required for this project, MariaDB is used in this project.
The corresponding sql file is in the other repository. 

Here is the brief introduction to the main files:
ADS1256.py; config.py; DAC8532.py; Reco4lifeP10A.py; search.py; smartplug.py; sunrise_sunset.py -- external libraries
